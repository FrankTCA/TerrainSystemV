# Terrain System V

Terrain System V is a new solution for an old problem -- Spigot has a terrible API for worldgen.

Terrain System V enables you to fork the repository and start creating worldgen for Spigot easily and with full control.

Unlike data driven solutions like OpenTerrainGenerator, there's nothing stopping you from extending TSV as much as you want.

However, even with little coding knowledge, Terrain System V is easy to interface with, as all you have to do is change a few Java files.

It will feel like data-driven even though you're editing code directly.

Terrain System V **is available for 1.17** and ready for whatever you want to throw at it.

We're currently in the prerelease phase but we will be releasing VERY SOON -- we just want to get polished up a little.

Both custom biomes and custom structures are available and easy to play around with.

So why not play around with it? See what TSV can offer. No longer will you have to reinvent the wheel just to create a worldgen algorithm.

All you have to do is fork it.
