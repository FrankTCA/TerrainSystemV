# FAQ

## Why the name Terrain System V?
I decided to use that name because of the fact that the first step is forking the project. It's name comes from the most forked project in computing history -- UNIX. Almost every modern Operating System except for Windows is based on UNIX, which is what I hope to one day become: what almost every Spigot worldgen algorithm bases itself on.

## How do your releases work?
I generally prefer not to release a new update to TSV very often. Every release means that worldgen developers will have the choice of whether or not to go through the somewhat difficult process of updating to the latest version of TSV. It is not required to update or not, and I will continue to answer questions on the Info Toast Discord ([https://discord.gg/rftS5NA](https://discord.gg/rftS5NA)) and help people out even if you're using an older release.

Unless something crazy happens, I will not provide a new release more often than every 3-4 months, however I will provide an update when there is a new Minecraft release available, if necessary.

## Recommended environment?
I recommend that you use IntelliJ IDEA, as that's normally what I use. I also recommend using Java 17 (I use Zulu JDK). Additionally, I recommend running Spigot BuildTools so it can update your local Maven repository.

We're still in prerelease stage, so more FAQ will be coming once more people ask questions.
